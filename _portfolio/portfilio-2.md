## What is it?
In this repo, I experimented with different Reinforcement learning techniques on the game of Strands.
I implemented a gym environment an trained a TD agent to play the game.
Strands is a simple strategy game where players take turns covering empty spaces on a hexagonal grid. It has similarities with Go.
